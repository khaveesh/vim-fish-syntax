# vim-fish-syntax
Syntax and ftplugin files for fish shell scripts

## Installation

I recommend the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager, but you can use any other plugin manager if you want.

In case of vim-plug, add the following line to your vimrc between the begin and end plug calls:

```vim
Plug 'khaveesh/vim-fish-syntax'
```

Then run :PlugInstall after sourcing your vimrc.
