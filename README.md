# vim-fish-syntax
Syntax and ftplugin files for fish shell scripts

## Installation

I recommend the native packages support built into Vim8 and NeoVim, but you can use any other plugin manager if you want.

In case of minpac, add the following line to your vimrc after the init call:

```vim
call minpac#add('khaveesh/vim-fish-syntax')
```

Then run :call minpac#update() after sourcing your vimrc.
